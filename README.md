# What is Karma?
##### MVC Framework for Unity3D
Karma is an MVC framework for Unity3D. Because of how Unity is structured, it actually turns out to be an MVCP architecture (Model/View/Controller/Presenter) where the Presenter is a MonoBehaviour that serves as an intermediary between the Controller and the View. You can read more about this in [MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER PATTERN FOR UNITY3D USER INTERFACES](http://engineering.socialpoint.es/MVC-pattern-unity3d-ui.html).

##### Based on Zenject
It's built on top of [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject) which provides Dependency Injection (DI). DI is mainly used to route the app to the desired view, it also enables us to build composable and testable systems.

##### Inspired by AngularJS and ASP vNext
Some of the basic constructs and code layout is inspired by other MVC frameworks such as AngularJS and ASP vNext.

##### Note to Game Developers
Karma uses concepts like *views* and *presenters* instead of `scenes`. The problem with scenes is that they are too heavy weight, there is no good way to communicate between them, changing scenes is slow (especially if you are doing UI stuff), and they aren't composable. 
The "Karmic" way of doing a game would be to store each level/scene in a prefab, treat it as a MVC View, store all your characters/entities in separate prefabs, and get them instantiated onto the level's view through DI.

##### Simple Routing System
Karma has a built in routing system that enables you to create isolated views/scenes as prefabs and easily switch between them. Using an `http-like` flow, a *presenter* can `Request` the `router` to render another view.

##### As Stateless as possible
Karma aims to be as stateless as possible to try to give you the guarantee that if you entered a view once with certain `Request` parameters and reached a successful state, then you will always reach that same state if you pass the the same parameters. Unity3D doesn't provide by default a *best practice* changing from a view to another. A common way to do this is to have all possible views instantiated in the scene but only enable the current one, the problem is that you maintain state when reusing Game Objects and often end in bad states because of the many paths you need to account for. Karma keeps things simple and functional by just destroying the *current* view and instantiates a new *next* view when changing views.

##### Message Passing
In Karma state is mainly maintained through message passing, being as true as possible to Go's philosophy:

>Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating.

The added benefit of this is that views become configurable without depending on local storage or static variables, is in turn is very important to keep a system testable.

##### Pub/Sub System
All `Presenters` integrate a pub/sub system that enables the communication between entities on different branches and levels in the dependency hierarchy. It's a simple yet powerful message passing mechanism on channels by topic where any `Presenter` can subscribe and broadcast. By convention the top level application is used as the main channel.

##### Folder Structure + Conventions
As many MVC frameworks, Karma tries to keep the developers sane by establishing conventions. Among these conventions are the folder structure, concepts (presenters, controllers, services, etc), code organization, a configuration mechanism (dev, prod, test environments).

## Parts
* Views
    - Plain old prefabs
* Presenters
    - Handle the presentation layer
    - Extend MonoBehaviour
    - Are tied to a Prefab
    - Get instantiated on Game Objects
    - Integrate a Pub/Sub mechanism
    - Are Transient
    - Are divided as:
        + *Plain* Presenter (Routable)
        + Elements (Reusable)
        + Layouts (Provide context)
* Controllers
    - Handle the logic layer
    - **Don't** extend MonoBehaviour
    - Are Transient
    - Are 100% testable
    - Are usually coupled to a Presenter
* Services
    - Handle Resources
    - Should be Stateless
    - Are Singleton
    - Usually handle communication with a server on a particular resource, local storage, specialized logic for e.g. handling certain user inputs, etc.
* Applications
    - Handle general configuration
    - Are Presenters
    - Contain the current view
    - Can be nested to create subviews
* Router
    - Belongs to a specific Application
    - Tells the application which view to render next
    - Can store request history
* Middleware
    - Each application can configure its one pipeline
    - Each middleware can modify the `Request` and `Response`
    - Enables to e.g. create an authentication layer separate from the view itself
    - It's asynchronous so e.g. http requests can be made to the server to get extra information

# Why Karma?
##### Unity3D doesn't give much structure
While good developers do follow certain conventions, new developers struggle to keep their project in order. Karma provides conventions for both code structure and folder organization so you can keep your project clean and productive.
##### Composable elements
Mainly thanks to Zenject, with Karma you can create composable elements that you can reuses through your application. Defining you all the components in your view/level directly in the hierarchy, with Karma you define each subcomponent in a separate prefab with their own presenter, and get them to you current view through DI. This way you avoid these common problems:
* Finding components in hierarchy (you can stop abusing `GameObject.Find`)
* Having to update prefabs that are also nested in other prefabs

##### Testable components
One of the major goals of Karma is testability. This is achieved through these mechanisms:

1. Configurable transient views
2. POCO `Controllers` and `Services` that are 100% mockable
3. Dependency Injection

# Getting Started
##### Sample Project
The easiest way to get started is to clone this repository and open it with Unity3D. It contains a sample project layout with an `Application`, `Presenter`, `Controller` and a `Service`. Just

```
git clone https://github.com/cgarciae/karma.git
```

and open the `karma` folder with Unity3D. Then open the scene `/Assets/App/App.unity` and hit play!

##### Integrating it with your project
The easiest way to integrate Karma with your own project is to clone this repo with

```
git clone https://github.com/cgarciae/karma.git
```

and then copy the folders `/Assets/App` and `/Assets/Lib` to your project.
